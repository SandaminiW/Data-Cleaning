# Data-Cleaning
Real World Project


## Project Overview
This project involves consolidating sales data from multiple months into a single dataset for analysis. The sales data, stored across several CSV files, is combined using Python's pandas library. The process involves reading all the files from a specified directory, concatenating the data into one large dataframe, and then saving the merged data into a new CSV file for easier accessibility. The dataset captures important sales metrics such as product names, quantities ordered, prices, and order dates. The purpose of the project is to streamline data management, enabling further analysis on sales trends, revenue generation, and customer demographics.

## Final Conclusion
The successful merging of monthly sales data into a unified file greatly simplifies the process of analyzing the dataset. This consolidated data can now be used to identify sales trends, determine best-selling products, and evaluate peak purchasing periods. Additionally, it offers a more efficient means of handling large volumes of data, providing a foundation for advanced analytical tasks such as forecasting and customer behavior analysis. Overall, the project demonstrates a scalable method for integrating fragmented data sources, ensuring consistency and ease of future analysis efforts. â€‹
